# aniZero (formerly saintly2k/aniZero)
World's (soon to be) most advanced Anime-CMS. Featuring a fully-fledged Account system, rating system, Anime &amp; Episode system, Comment system, Administration panel and embedding Videos of multiple Streaming-Services (such as MixDrop or Streamtape), it can serve you as your very first and own Website such as 9anime or Animixplay. In addition, it's beautifully styled with Bootstrap and CSS. Everything thanks to the power of PHP and MySQL. (Also, this project is not affiliated with the Spanish Anime site)
